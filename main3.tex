\section{Course Overview}
  This course will teach students interested in Blackjack how to play as well as teach strategies on the best decisions to make in common game situations.

The class time will be split up with half the time as instruction and the other half with hands-on play with what was taught in class.
   
  
\section{The Rule}
Blackjack is a popular casino game that is played between the player and the dealer. The objective is to try and beat the dealer by picking up a score of 21 on the first two cards, which is why the game is also referred to as 21. You can do this by:

\begin
Scoring 21 on the first two cards dealt, as long as the dealer does not have the same hand. This hand is called a blackjack.
Beating the dealer’s final score without getting over 21.
Allowing the dealer to extend his hand with additional cards and getting his score to go over 21.
