\section{The Rule}
Blackjack is a popular casino game that is played between the player and the dealer. The objective is to try and beat the dealer by picking up a score of 21 on the first two cards, which is why the game is also referred to as 21. You can do this by:

\begin
Scoring 21 on the first two cards dealt, as long as the dealer does not have the same hand. This hand is called a blackjack.
Beating the dealer’s final score without getting over 21.
Allowing the dealer to extend his hand with additional cards and getting his score to go over 21.
